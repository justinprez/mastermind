# Mastermind

This project is a recreation of the classic game Mastermind as a mobile application. Mastermind is code-breaking game, where one player must guess the correct ordered sequence of colours. The purpose of this project was to gain experience in programming with [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and developing applications using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), Google's UI toolkit. Follow the installation and setup instructions in the [src](/src) folder to run the implementation.

This project was originally inspired by https://github.com/philshem/open-mastermind.
